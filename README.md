# 🛠️ ChipperBOT – Your AI Tool Finder

**ChipperBOT** is a web-based assistant that helps you discover the best AI tools for your work.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a project I built for my **first ever college hackathon**.  
Before this, I was only working on basic HTML/CSS static pages to get comfortable with layouts. Those early pages weren’t perfect (things broke when the screen size changed 😅), but they helped me learn how to structure a webpage.

Surprisingly, despite never building a full website before, **ChipperBOT turned out quite well — and fully responsive**.  
I didn’t even use media queries. Just pure Grid layout and relative units like `%`, `rem`, `vh`, and `vw`.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Grid + Flexbox)  
- JavaScript (coming soon)  
- Responsive design (no media queries!)

## 🌱 What I Learned

- Proper layout structuring using Grid  
- How relative units improve responsiveness  
- That small practice projects are actually useful!

## 🤓 Side Note

We’ve officially moved on from making cards and small HTML/CSS pages — now working on a bot that helps people find bots 😄.

Originally, the plan was to keep practicing static pages until I was comfortable, then slowly get into JavaScript.  
But then this hackathon popped up — and I just jumped in.

Even though the pages I made before had layout issues, they gave me a good idea of how to organize a webpage.  
This one surprisingly turned out nice. Didn’t even use media queries, yet it works on all devices!

So yeah, not perfect — but honestly, **I’m proud of how far this came** for a first-time hackathon project.
