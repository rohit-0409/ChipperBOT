## 🤖 What is ChipperBOT?

ChipperBOT is designed to make exploring the world of AI tools as easy and intuitive as possible.

With hundreds of AI tools launching every month, it’s hard to know which ones are useful or relevant. ChipperBOT solves this by giving you a **search-first interface** where you can type what you’re looking for (e.g., “image generator”, “text summarizer”, “code helper”) — and it returns a curated list of AI tools that match.

It’s like a search engine, but focused entirely on AI tools.  
Simple keywords, instant results.

You don’t need to scroll endlessly through lists — just type and discover.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned / In Progress)

- 🧠 **Smart keyword-based search**  
  Type a word like "resume" or "chatbot", and ChipperBOT finds tools that fit.

- 🧩 **Categorized tool listings**  
  AI tools are tagged under categories like writing, productivity, code, media, etc.

- 🔎 **Filter-friendly interface** *(planned)*  
  In the future, filters will help narrow your search by use case, price, or rating.

- 📱 **Fully responsive design**  
  Works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop — even without media queries (so far!).

- ⚡ **Lightweight and fast**  
  No bloat. No framework overhead. Just HTML, CSS, and soon, JavaScript.

## 🚀 About the Project

This is a project I built for my **first ever college hackathon**.  
Before this, I was only working on basic HTML/CSS static pages to get comfortable with layouts. Those early pages weren’t perfect (things broke when the screen size changed 😅), but they helped me learn how to structure a webpage.

Surprisingly, despite never building a full website before, **ChipperBOT turned out quite well — and fully responsive**.  
I didn’t even use media queries. Just pure Grid layout and relative units like `%`, `rem`, `vh`, and `vw`.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Grid + Flexbox)  
- JavaScript (coming soon)  
- Responsive design (no media queries so far!)(Its looking good tho i will stil use it to change few things. But it mostly very responsive and looks in the all the devices.)

## 🌱 What I Learned

- Proper layout structuring using Grid  
- How relative units improve responsiveness  
- That small practice projects are actually useful!

## 🤓 Side Note

We’ve officially moved on from making cards and small HTML/CSS pages — now working on a bot that helps people find bots 😄.

Originally, the plan was to keep practicing static pages until I was comfortable, then slowly get into JavaScript.  
But then this hackathon popped up — and I just jumped in.

Even though the pages I made before had layout issues, they gave me a good idea of how to organize a webpage.  
This one surprisingly turned out nice. Didn’t even use media queries, yet it works on all devices!

So yeah, not perfect — but honestly, **I’m proud of how far this came** for a first-time hackathon project.
